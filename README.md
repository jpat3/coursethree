the run analysis file contains the code used to combine Samsung accelerometer data and output a tidy data set.

this script performs the following tasks, for completion of Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project:
    
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement.
    
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
    
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
with the average of each variable for each activity and each
subject.
    
The script should be run from WD in a folder location in the directory
above the extracted data files.
